# Tiger-Identification
Here I have added the Code for a Tiger Identification Project where we can uniquely and accurately identify tigers using their Stripe patterns, this serves as an invaluable tool for the bio-diversity parks owners and zoo-keepers to keep track of each tiger.

Leveraging CNN and deep learning techniques, specifically the ResNet-50 model, I was able to achieve an impressive 96.41% accuracy. This innovative method is a significant step forward in monitoring tiger populations and supporting conservation efforts.
